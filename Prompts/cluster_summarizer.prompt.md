You are given short paper records for one thematic cluster. Each record may include a title, year, keywords, a short summary, and a few takeaways.

TASK 1: Invent a short cluster name (3–6 words).
- Use concrete nouns and technical terms.
- Avoid vague names like "Misc", "Various", "Other", "General".

TASK 2: Write one paragraph meta-summary (4–6 sentences) describing:
- the shared problem/question
- the common approaches/methods
- typical data/evaluation setting (if mentioned)
- key variants/disagreements inside the cluster (if any)
- what makes this cluster distinct from nearby topics (based on the records)

Rules:
- Use only the provided records; do not guess missing details.
- If an important detail is missing, write "Not specified in the provided records."
- Meta-summary must be a single paragraph (no bullet lists).

Respond EXACTLY in this format:

Cluster name: <name>
Meta-summary: <paragraph>

Summaries:
{{summaries}}
