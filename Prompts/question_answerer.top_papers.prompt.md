Use the following papers to answer the research question as a quant researcher.

Question:
{{question}}

Papers:
{{papers_context}}

Write a concise survey-style answer in 3-6 paragraphs:
- Group similar approaches and name representative papers.
- Explain the core idea and what it would look like as a tradeable hypothesis.
- Call out data requirements, horizon, and evaluation gotchas (leakage, costs, regime dependence) if inferable.
- If something is unclear from the summaries, say so explicitly.

End with a short "Prototype checklist" of 4-7 bullets: minimal viable experiment steps.
