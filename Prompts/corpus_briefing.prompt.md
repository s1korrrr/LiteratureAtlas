You are given a topic hierarchy (mega-topics and subtopics) with sample paper titles and keyword themes.
The goal is to summarize the corpus at a high level for a technically savvy reader.

Write a Markdown briefing with these sections (use these exact headings):

# Executive Summary
# Theme Map
# Methods & Data
# Key Debates / Tensions
# Frontiers & Open Questions
# Suggested Reading Path

Guidelines:
- Use the provided topic names, keywords, and sample titles.
- Prefer concrete phrases over vague claims.
- If something is not supported by the context, say "Not enough evidence in the provided metadata."
- Keep the whole response under ~900 words.
- When mentioning papers, cite by title (no authors/venues unless explicitly present).
- If the hierarchy suggests time structure (years/eras), reflect it cautiously (only if present).

Context:
{{context}}
